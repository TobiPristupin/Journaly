        /*
        For all the following comments in this method, take as an example a goal that requires the user to post 3 journal entries every 4 days.

        First we must group all journal entries into their different groups. We must create a group for all entries posted between [0, 4) days
        after the creation of the goal, another entry for posts created [4, 8) days, another for posts created [8, 12) days, and so on.
        We then must make sure of two things:
            1) We have the number of required groups: If this goal was created 12 days ago, we need the three groups described above.
              For example, we cannot be missing group [4, 8), since that means the user has no posts in that timeframe.
            2) Every group meets the minimum number of posts. For this example, every group must have at least 3 posts.

        HOWEVER, we must be careful not to analyze the final group. Say the goal above was created 9 days ago, thus we would end up
        creating groups for days [0,4), [4,8), and (8,9]. Since our last interval (8,9] is still ongoing (we have three days left)
        then we cannot yet consider a goal "not met" if the user hasn't posted 3 times in (8,9]. We must wait until the interval completes.

        How will we implement this? Make an array of length: required number of groups. Fill it with zeros. Iterate through all posts,
        and calculate their corresponding group. Add one to the array at the position of the corresponding group. Once finished, the array should
        have no zeros, and all numbers > than the required number of posts per group.

        every 4 days, then (int) (11/4) = 2, which corresponds to groups [0,4), [4,8). The reason we don't include [8, 12) is explained
